# Wine Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning

This GitHub repository contains a wine quality prediction project that utilizes a variety of machine learning classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC), Support Vector Classifier with a polynomial kernel (SVC), and Decision Tree Classifier. The project involves the assessment of wine quality based on two distinct datasets: one for red wine and another for white wine. Additionally, data preprocessing steps, such as data cleaning and outlier removal using the Interquartile Range (IQR) rule, were employed to ensure data quality.

## Overview

This project aims to predict the quality of both red and white wines by employing machine learning algorithms. The key components of this repository include:

1. **Datasets**: Two separate datasets, one for red wine and one for white wine, are provided for analysis. These datasets are the foundation for quality prediction.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Thorough data cleaning procedures were executed to handle inconsistencies and missing values, guaranteeing that the datasets were ready for analysis.

3. **Outlier Removal**: The Interquartile Range (IQR) rule was applied to detect and remove outliers from the data, enhancing the reliability of predictive models.

4. **Machine Learning Models**: Four classification algorithms—Logistic Regression, LinearSVC, SVC with a polynomial kernel, and Decision Tree Classifier—were employed to predict wine quality for each dataset.

5. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of each machine learning model was assessed using standard classification metrics, such as accuracy_score.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the selected models further.
